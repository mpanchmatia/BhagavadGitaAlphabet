# BhagavadGitaAlphabet
Character count in unicode text of Bhagavad Gita - a Sanskrit scripture that is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata

Once Guruji Sri Sri Ravishankar mentioned in Satsang about relation between evolution and sequence of characters in Sanskrit alphabet. I captured the content from Guru Vani 8.5.13, as mentioned in reference. 

As I recall, He mentioned something like that group of characters, for sounds made by birds, another group of characters are sound made by amphibians, and another group of characters are sound made by mammals. All Mantra always contains character from Ya, Ra, La, Va, Ha, Sha, sha, Sa sound. The sound Ha indicates misery, pain, OR getting relief from pain, misery. 

Based on, this I tried to analyse Unicode text of Shrimad Bhagavad Gita. 

This Python code, count occurrence of each character and mapped it to its speaker, who utter that character. Shrimad Bhagavad Gita has only four speakers: 

1. "Arjun"
2. "Bhagawan"
3. "Sanjay"
4. "Dhritarashtra"

For shake of programming, I added one more dummy speaker 

5. "None"

The code is self-explanatory. However, I added few comments, to make it more readable. 

Reference

Guru Vani 8.5.13 (8th May 2013) Guruji Sri Sri Ravishankar mentioned in Satsang :

...... the sounds Ka क and CHa च are made only by birds , excepting the parrot and myna which can be taught different sounds. Ta and Tha are made by amphibians like frog, and Pa प and MA म by Mammals, sheep goat, cows. The ways alphabets were arranged is close to nature.It was downloaded during meditation . Rishi's said I heard it during meditation.

Other relevant content from the Satsang about Sanskrit alphabet: 
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Say Ka without saying "aaaa"., Say ga without saying "aaaa", Say cha without saying "aaaa".You cannot say consonants without the vowel. This is how the consonants and the vowels are arranged in the Sanskrit language.

2. K and "i( as in ink)" makes it " kee".The Deva Bhasha Sanskrit is scientifically arranged.

3. How is a sound generated? when the soul and intellect joins the mind,it enhances the energy of the body.That energy moves the voice box. So scientifically said. This knowledge is perfect combination of head to heart.

4. The sounds in music

Sa- the peacock
Re - the cow
Ga-the goats
Ma-Crane/Seagull
Pa-Nightingale
Da- Horse
Ni- Elephant

Moreover the sounds Ka and CHa are made only by birds , excepting the parrot and myna which can be taught different sounds. Ta and Tha are made by amphibians like frog, and Pa and MA by Mammals, sheep goat, cows. The ways alphabets were arranged is close to nature. It was downloaded during meditation . Rishi's said I heard it during meditation.
